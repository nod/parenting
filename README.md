misc things to help with parenting children in this screwed up digital world

## tinyproxy

I have whitelisted out certain websites through tiny proxy and block all
outbound traffic for some devices we have and they only go through a proxy using
this whitelist.

- Why so many one-off's for apple.com?

BECAUSE I don't want my young children to have giphy image search! Suuure, they
think they're searching for something innocent but then ... they learn new
words.
